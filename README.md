# UL Student Records System – Object Oriented Development Project

This project is a **student records system** designed for the University of Limerick (UL).  

The system allows UL to manage different programme types (undergraduate, postgraduate, taught, and research) with varying durations and structures.  

Key features include:  
- **Student Records Management**: Store and update student results (grades by module per semester).  
- **QCA Calculations**: Automatic calculation of QCA per semester, year, and programme.  
- **Progression Tracking**: Identify students who do not meet the minimum academic standards for progression.  
- **Student Access**: Students can log in and review their transcript.  
- **Faculty Access**: Faculty can look up transcripts and submit module results.  
- **Department Access**: Departments can conduct examination boards to review progression.  
- **Data Storage**: All data stored in CSV files.  
- **Interface**: Command-line interface (CLI) for students, faculty, and administrators.
